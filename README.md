# Lavender

A good looking dark purple-ish theme for powercord.

If you got any suggestions for / issues with this theme just ping @Obscure.#4719 in #theme-dev of powercord server or open an issue here with the given templates.

# Important

When scrolling through member lists and long channel lists, the scrollbar randomly gets stuck and starts flickering. To get rid of this annoyance you can try the below fixes:

## Fix 1

Fix 1 is by downloading a plugin called [SmoothScrollPowercord](https://github.com/LynithDev/SmoothScrollPowerCord) for powercord. (I didnt find a plugin similar to this for BetterDiscord so if you know of any let me know üëç)

## Fix 2

Fix 2 is by unloading a part of the theme, this will make the channel list and members list a little ugly so only use this if Fix 1 doesn't work for you.

### For powercord

- **Step 1:** Go to `src` folder and open the `source.scss` file.

- **Step 2:** Inside `source.scss` file remove this line: `@forward "components/membersList";` 

  You will need to repeat this thing everytime you update Lavender theme.

### For BetterDiscord

This method for BetterDiscord is coming soon. üòÅ Watch this repo so you know when its updated. üëç
