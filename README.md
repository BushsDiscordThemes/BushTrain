# Lavender

A good looking dark purple-ish theme for powercord.

This theme uses some snippets from [@CorellanStoma#1996](https://github.com/CorellanStoma), [@LuckFire#4800](https://github.com/LuckFire) and [@mr_miner#9699](https://github.com/mr-miner1) so credits to them. üëç

Also if you got any suggestions for / issues with this theme just ping @Obscure.#4719 in #theme-dev of powercord server or open an issue here.

# Screenshots

The below screenshot is currently outdated, I'll update it soon with screenshots that better represent the theme

# Support

Support for other clients like better discord and goosemod will come soon!

# Server

Lavender doesn't have a server of its own obviously but I do have a random community server called Gradient, you can join it for some fun maybe ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
